#### 🧺 [Dimensionality Reduction via Graph-based Feature Selection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10817068)

Me 👋; Parnika Singh; Anitha J (CSITSS 2024)

we built a graph-based algorithm to spot and remove redundant features in big datasets by treating highly correlated features as connected nodes. it runs faster than pca and does better for storage and training.

this algorithm was the preliminary version of what became [Raven](/?content=projects.md#projects-raven)

#### 🏥 [Privacy Preservation of Cluster Integrity on Web-Scraped Hospital Data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10958977)

Me 👋; Dharmisht SVK; J Krishna Kaarthik; Dhyaan Kotian; Shashidhar Virupaksha (ICAECT 2025)

we came up with a way to anonymize sensitive geospatial data by clustering locations based on influence and shifting coordinates inside clusters. it keeps the patterns intact while hiding the real points.
