some of the stuff i built:

---

#### ‚ò∏Ô∏è [Ved](https://ved-one.vercel.app/) ‚Äì full stack mock website

_postgres, react, css, mistral api_

a site for research collaboration.

- has search, auth, clean styling.
- wired up postgres with heavy joins and used generative ai to make synthetic data.
- hacked around a super rate-limited llm with exponential backoff (this was cool in early 2024).

[i mean you should see the joins](https://pastes.io/ved-user-page-view).

there's also a [cool youtube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsQshAGo5vU)

#### üåç [State of the World](https://stateoftheworld.vercel.app/) ‚Äì climate change visualizer

_azure, mern stack, three.js, cosmos db_

visualizes climate data and news for major economies.

- 3d globe with three.js and a node backend that caches data from cosmos db.
- visualizes country-specific temperature changes, co2, and general sentiment.
- all of this is updated every month with serverless.
- used cloud AI trained on a custom dataset for estimating if news reported that month was good or bad for climate change.
- the custom dataset was downloaded more than 600 times on [kaggle](https://kaggle.com/datasets/fringewidth/climate-change-news)

the backend API is also open source.

#### üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ [Raven](https://github.com/fringewidth/raven) ‚Äì dimensionality reduction

_graph theory, data analysis_

- feature selection algorithm based on graph theory.
- upto 70% reduction in bloated datasets.
- 40 lines of code (minus docstrings and empty lines)
- my proudest creation.

[there's an unfinished preprint on this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D6dzpmQe6o1U1X3-4uvdHB287tvvCE2a/view?usp=sharing). there's ablation, mathematical proof on why it works, few case studies, everything. one day i will find the time to seek its publication.

#### üï∏Ô∏è [Arachnid](https://github.com/dragn0id/arachnid) ‚Äì web scraping chrome extension

_dom tree, react_

- chrome extension that grabs correlated elements on a page in one click.
- tested it on amazon, google search, bigbasket, ndtv, india today.
- this was a group project. my contribution was mostly designing the actual scraping algorithm, [ScrapeData.js](https://github.com/dragn0id/arachnid/blob/main/src/components/customComponents/utils/ScrapeData.js) and [selectData.js](https://github.com/dragn0id/arachnid/blob/main/src/components/customComponents/utils/selectData.js)

#### üìà [JFit](https://github.com/fringewidth/jfit2) ‚Äì empirical complexity guesser

_java, python, scipy, junit_

- it takes in array functions.
- spits out their complexity.
- first coding project.

[here's the result for bubble sort.](https://tinyurl.com/jfit-bubble-sort)

[also ported it to cpp](https://github.com/fringewidth/cppFit)

### üìë [This website!](https://github.com/fringewidth/fringewidth.github.io)

_html, css, jquery_

this entire website is written in my favourite markup, markdown(lol). you can find this page's source [here](https://github.com/fringewidth/fringewidth.github.io/blob/main/projects.md).

after building grandiose websites, you tend to admire the simplicity of the early internet.

thanks to [Marked](https://marked.js.org/), there's only about 80 lines of HTML, most of it is for this footer ‚¨áÔ∏è.
